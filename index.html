<h1> Methodology, tools and data source </h1>

<p>The research started off with a clear idea in mind: exploring the life and works of three classical composers: Johann Sebastian Bach, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig van Beethoven and retrieve data about the musicians from large datasets in order to tell a story, as if we were data journalists. We could argue that our main method was based on deductive reasoning, that is, starting from a general idea and proceeding toward a more specific one. 
Our main data source has been Wikidata and we chose it because we expected to find much information on such famous and relevant authors. We then started by looking for general information on the authors by means of very simple questions: where they were born, who were the members of their family, where they traveled and how they were influenced as composers by those experiences, how many instruments they could play, how many works they composed. We first of all tried to retrieve information from the Wikidata query service by using SPARQL engine, where queries are structured in triples: simple syntax consisting of a subject, a predicate and an object. Not all the attempts were actually successful and we had several goes before getting our queries done, but this will be better explored in the section on the challenges. Furthermore, we also used constraints to limit the data we got, we mainly used UNION, LIMIT, DESC, ASC and FILTER to get results in English.
Once we got our information back, we finally went on Melody to create our data story. As for the major tools, we mainly referred to tables, maps, barcharts and line charts and doughnut charts to represent our data. All of these tools surely helped us in creating a synthesis of all the heterogeneous information we had retrieved from wikidata. Another essential tool was the text function, which enabled us to not only to visualize the story, but also connect the information retrieved. </p>


<h1>The challenges we faced</h1>

<p>In the realization of our project, we have faced many challenges. To begin with, we had problems in creating the queries and in writing them with proper SPARQL language and syntax: one of the key issues we needed to deal with concerned the proper selection of semantic items to ensure the proper functioning of the queries in both Wikidata and Melody. Besides, syntactical issues were another major aspect of the process of query-creation: the major issues had to do with the arrangement of commands, that is both the proper combination of query items and, above all, the formulation of the right question. In some cases, for instance, we needed to change and rearrange the query either when we did not get back any matching or fewer results; in such cases, we needed to make both syntactic and semantic reformulation of the query, which basically influenced the method of information retrieval. 
Another great problem concerns the technical functioning of Melody since the platform was not always working. For instance, properly-arranged queries that would function efficiently on Wikidata did not always come out in Melody at all; in some other cases we had problem with the visualization of the information: this basically concerned the right selection of certain types of graphs and tables for data representation, for example, we needed to switch from barcharts and line charts to tables (and vice versa) to be able to properly visualize our information; thirdly, in some other occasions we hypothesize that, due to overloading of the website, it was not always possible to save or publish the retrieved data, which was very time-consuming for the group. 
As for the creation of the website, the major concern was the layout of the page and the overall rendering of the information, in both textually and visually appealing ways. For example, it took us much time to align the images to text parts or to run out the videos. Finally we had problems with converting the information of the website to Github.
